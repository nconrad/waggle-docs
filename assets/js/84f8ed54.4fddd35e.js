If bandwidth and training computational times are both cost factors, then sampling at around 30% of the bandwidth (900 images per batch for the car experiment) would yield the highest gains at minimal cost. Sampling the images with predicted confidences above the median confidence or along a normal probability density curve centered at 0.5 would also be optimal for maximizing model improvements with smaller retraining times. However, these conclusions may vary with tasks that are significantly different from car body type detection and classification."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"In general, across the \u2018easier\u2019 character classification task and the \u2018harder\u2019 car task, the (binned) normal PDF at 0.5 confidence and below median threshold sampling methods are promising for the largest improvements. They have relatively short median training times (and high efficiency), while they demonstrate noticeable accuracy improvements after several batches of retraining, comparable to the best methods. We should also aim to prioritize sampling a greater spread of confidences at higher bandwidths so the model can better generalize to a variety of inputs, and taking high-uncertainty samples may be a more effective approach at lower bandwidths to learn quickly through each batch."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Future work\nGoing forward, I would want to run more experiments to better support my conclusions, continuing to examine the relationships between sampling methods and bandwidth sizes. Potential directions to consider include true object detection models (as both experiments had test data that were pre-cropped), classification/detection with known datasets like MNIST and COCO, and examining regression and time series problems."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"It would also be interesting to create sampling methods and correlations based on sample confidence score variance when performing the linear average of checkpoint models, as that data is also available at the edge and may provide an additional measure of uncertainty. We could also optimize stop criteria to reduce the number of training epochs per batch and further investigate effects of bandwidth limit values. Finally, we could try to automate the selection of hyperparameters and sampling methods based on a small initial test set and baseline model (using data from the edge), so solutions to this bandwidth problem could be applicable to all machine learning models deployed on Sage."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"I\u2019d like to thank all of the Sage staff and my fellow interns for providing guidance and helping me learn more about machine learning this summer.
