Particularly, snowflake shape study has been of keen interests for its applications including storm prediction, more insight in precipitation microphysics, snowfall velocity prediction, water content prediction, snow-to-liquid ratio, etc. The snow habits help determine association with temperature and supersaturation in the clouds.

So a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) is put in place which is ground-based and captures pictures of snow (or rain) falling from three different angles alongside their fall velocity. Conventionally, these images are classified into types of snowflakes based on different image processing methods.

Neural networks, inspired by neural connections in the human brain, consists of different layers made up of interconnected neurons. A neural network has an input layer where we feed in the data or the input signal, hidden layers where most of the computation and learning occurs and an output layer, where we get the results.
